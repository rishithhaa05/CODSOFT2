        <h3>Detection of Suicidal Related Posts</h3>
        <p>While social media allows people to connect easily, it also puts children at risk of dangerous online situations. Cyberbullying has become a serious and growing problem. To prevent harm, we need smart systems that can automatically detect risky or harmful messages, since the internet is filled with massive amounts of information.

            Online predators often try to build trust with children by giving them attention, gifts, and by showing interest in their lives. They may act kind and understanding, learn about children's hobbies, and slowly introduce inappropriate content in conversations.
            
            Our proposed solution aims to detect suspicious profiles by identifying patterns of child grooming behavior, hate speech, stalking, bullying, and sharing of explicit contentâ€”through posts, comments, or interactions on social media and websites.</p>

        <h3>Smart Canteen System </h3>
        <p>Managing a canteen is crucial for many institutions and organizations, providing food and a place for people to gather. This introduction looks at the important role of canteen management, its challenges, and how modern food services are changing. Running a canteen requires careful coordination of tasks like inventory control, menu planning, staff management, order processing, billing, and balancing food quality with cost. Recently, technology has transformed canteen management with digital solutions, software, and automated systems that simplify processes, improve customer experiences, and make food service operations more efficient.
